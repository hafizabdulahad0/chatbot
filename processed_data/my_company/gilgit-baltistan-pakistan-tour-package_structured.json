      "content": "Hunza Valley is one of the top tourist attraction points in Northern Areas Tour Packages. We offer Hunza Valley 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9-day trips to cover all main tourist places. The most historical place to visit in Hunza is the Baltit & Altit Fort with your local tour guide, founded in the 8th century. You can see the mountain diversity of Nagar Valley (Home of Rakaposhi – The Mother of Mist) right from Hunza Karimabad. Trip to Hunza Valley offers many attractions such as Eagles Nest Hunza, Attabad Lake, and Passu Cones. We offer custom Hunza Tour packages, which include comfortable stays at hotels in Hunza in Karimabad, Passu, and Attabad Lake. Visit the Khunjerab Pass (Pakistan-China Border) on a day tour in this package. We have much time to cross the Hussaini Suspension Bridge and boating activities at Attabad Lake. Take photographs with the backdrop of Passu Peaks. Karimabad is the capital of Hunza Valley, surrounded by the mighty Karakoram mountains. You will spend the night in a nice hotel in Karimabad, wake up early to a spectacular sunrise over Rakaposhi, then explore the thousand-year-old Altit and Baltit forts and overnight at Eagle’s Nest."
